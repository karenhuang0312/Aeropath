## 3. Project Overview  
A flight booking website that leverages the AviationStack API (or similar) to allow users to search for flights, browse destinations, and easily look up tickets. The website provides sorting options by price and airline, and features a simple account system (sign in/sign up, no email/number required). The MVP will be ready for demo by the end of the week.

## 4. Problem Statement  
Finding and booking flights online can be overwhelming due to cluttered interfaces and too many requirements. Our site aims to simplify the process, making it easier for users to browse destinations, compare prices, and quickly find flights without needing to provide personal information like email or phone number.
