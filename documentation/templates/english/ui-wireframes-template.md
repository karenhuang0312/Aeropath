# UI Wireframes Template

## Update this document as we decide on how the UI should look. What is present here is simply a prototype.


## Overview
The Flight Booking Website MVP provides a clean, intuitive way to search and compare flights. The app starts with a language selection screen (English, Spanish, Mandarin), followed by a homepage to browse popular destinations, a form to search and sort flights, and basic user authentication (sign in/sign up, no email/number required). Users are redirected to the airline’s official website to book.
